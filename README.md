This paper investigates the predictive capabilities of logistic
regression in identifying credit card clients at the highest risk
of defaulting on payments in the subsequent month. Utilizing
the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset, which
encompasses a comprehensive array of demographic
factors, credit data, and payment history of clients in Taiwan
from April 2005 to September 2005, our analysis aims to
discern the pivotal features influencing default behavior.
The research questions guiding our inquiry delve into the
effectiveness of machine learning in credit risk assessment,
the socio-economic factors correlated with default likelihood,
and the discernible spending habits predictive of future
default occurrences.
Logistic regression, chosen for its aptitude in binary
classification tasks, serves as the predictive model. Through
a systematic evaluation of model performance and feature
importance, we elucidate the determinants driving credit card
default and shed light on actionable insights for financial
institutions.
The findings highlight the key predictors such as repayment
status, credit limit, and payment history exerting substantial
influence. Additionally, demographic and socio-economic
factors such as age, education, and marital status exhibit
notable associations with default propensity.
Furthermore, our analysis unveils discernible patterns in
customer spending habits that portend future default
occurrences, providing valuable insights for risk mitigation
strategies.
This study underscores the application of data science in
business analytics, showcasing how the fusion of statistical
analyses and machine learning techniques can yield
actionable insights for risk management in the financial
sector.
The implications of our findings extend beyond predictive
accuracy, offering avenues for informed decision-making and
proactive intervention to safeguard against credit card
defaults.
